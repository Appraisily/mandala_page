# Mandala Ourense - Design Recommendations

## Visual Identity

### Color Palette
Recommended to use a palette that reflects the calm, spiritual nature of a yoga studio:

**Primary Colors:**
- Soft teal/turquoise (#4ECDC4) - Represents tranquility and healing
- Deep purple (#6C5B7B) - Represents spirituality and wisdom
- Warm beige/sand (#F7F9F9) - Represents neutrality and calm

**Accent Colors:**
- Gold/amber (#F9A826) - Represents energy and vitality
- Terracotta (#C06C52) - Represents grounding and earth elements

### Typography

**Headings:**
- A serif font with spiritual/eastern influences (suggestions: Garamond, Cormorant Garamond)
- Alternative: A clean sans-serif with slight rounded edges for softness

**Body Text:**
- A highly readable sans-serif font (suggestions: Open Sans, Nunito, Lato)
- Slightly larger than standard for improved readability

**Special Elements:**
- Consider a decorative font for very limited use (quotes, special headings) that has a spiritual/mandala feeling

### Imagery Style

**Photography:**
- Authentic, natural photos of the actual studio and practitioners
- Soft, natural lighting
- People in various yoga poses
- Close-ups of hands in mudras
- Gentle, natural environments
- Avoid overly processed stock photos

**Illustrations:**
- Simple line art representing yoga poses
- Mandala designs (connecting to the brand name)
- Sacred geometry patterns as subtle background elements
- Organic, flowing shapes

### Overall Design Elements

**Shapes:**
- Circles (representing mandalas and wholeness)
- Soft, rounded corners on containers
- Flowing, curved dividers between sections
- Avoid hard angles and sharp corners

**Textures:**
- Subtle natural textures (wood, stone, fabric)
- Light paper or natural fiber backgrounds
- Avoid heavy or distracting textures

**Space:**
- Generous whitespace to create a sense of calm
- Allow content to breathe
- Avoid cluttered layouts

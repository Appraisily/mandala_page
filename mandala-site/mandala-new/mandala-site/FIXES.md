# Mandala Site Fixes

## Fixed Issues

### 1. Broken Images
We replaced all external image references (from Unsplash and RandomUser API) with local images:

- Created an `images` directory in the `public` folder
- Downloaded the required images locally
- Updated all component references to use local image paths
- Updated `next.config.js` to support unoptimized images for Netlify

#### Components Updated:
- `testimonials-section.tsx`: Changed avatar images from RandomUser API to local images
- `cta-section.tsx`: Updated background image to local file
- `hero-section.tsx`: Updated hero background to local file  
- `therapies-section.tsx`: Updated therapy images to local files
- `classes-section.tsx`: Updated class images to local files
- `about/page.tsx`: Updated studio and teacher images to local files
- `terapias/client-page.tsx`: Updated all therapy images to local files

### 2. Next.js Configuration
- Updated `next.config.js` to properly handle local images in production builds
- Added `unoptimized: true` for Netlify compatibility

### 3. Fixes Not Implemented
Some issues from the initial report still need to be addressed:

1. **404 Resource Errors**: Console was showing 404 errors for various resources
2. **Potential CSP Issues**: Content Security Policy might need updates to allow local images

## Next Steps

1. **Testing**: The site should be rebuilt and redeployed to verify fixes
2. **Monitoring**: Check for any remaining 404 errors or image loading issues
3. **Performance**: Consider image optimization strategies for better loading times
4. **Documentation**: Update development documentation with information about local image usage

## Details of Issues

### Broken Images
The site is using Unsplash images and RandomUser API images that are failing to load. This is likely because:
- The image URLs might be incorrect
- The source might be blocking the requests from Netlify
- The image optimization in Next.js might be misconfigured for the Netlify environment

### Admin Credentials Exposure
The admin password is visible in both:
- `/docs` page in the "Admin Panel" section
- `ADMIN_GUIDE.md` file

### Next Steps
1. **Immediate Fixes:**
   - Remove admin credentials from docs page
   - Fix H1 heading on admin page
   - Consider replacing broken images with local assets

2. **Long-term Improvements:**
   - Implement proper authentication without hardcoded credentials
   - Add better error handling for image loading
   - Improve accessibility across all pages

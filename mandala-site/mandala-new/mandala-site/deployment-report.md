# Mandala Site Deployment Report

## Issue Summary

The Netlify build was failing with the error:
```
Type error: File '/opt/build/repo/mandala-site/mandala-new/mandala-site/src/app/yoga/page.tsx' is not a module.
```

This error occurred because the `yoga/page.tsx` file was not properly exporting a React component as required by Next.js.

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Module Export Fix

Fixed the `yoga/page.tsx` file to properly export a React component:
- Added proper React import
- Fixed the component to export a valid React component function
- Made yogaStyles data non-exported (Next.js doesn't allow exporting data variables from page components)

### 2. Image Asset Management

Created a comprehensive image management system:
- Added missing images from repository root to their correct locations
- Created a `SafeImage` component to handle missing images gracefully
- Implemented fallback images for common categories
- Added proper image directory structure

### 3. Component Resilience

Made components more resilient to missing assets:
- Updated HeroSection to use the SafeImage component
- Updated YogaStylesSection to handle missing images
- Added image mapping for consistent fallbacks

### 4. Configuration Updates

Updated Netlify configuration:
- Fixed netlify.toml with proper settings
- Updated next.config.js for proper static export
- Added SPA fallback redirects

   - Run the site locally to check all routes
   - Run the test-deployment.js script to verify components

2. **Netlify Deployment**
   - Commit all changes
   - Push to the repository
   - Deploy to Netlify
   - Verify all routes on the deployed site

3. **Future Improvements**
   - Add more actual images to replace fallbacks
   - Implement proper image optimization with Next.js
   - Add automated testing for image assets
   - Create documentation for adding new images

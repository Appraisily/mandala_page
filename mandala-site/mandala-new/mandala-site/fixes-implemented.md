# Mandala Site Fixes Implemented

## Critical Issues Fixed

### 1. Removed Admin Credentials Exposure
- **Docs Page**: Removed hardcoded password from `/docs` page, replacing it with a secure message: `[Contacta al administrador]`
- **Admin Guide**: Updated `ADMIN_GUIDE.md` to remove hardcoded password
- **Knowledge Base**: Updated `KNOWLEDGE_BASE.md` to remove hardcoded password
- **Admin Authentication**: Modified the admin authentication to use environment variables for more secure password management

### 2. Fixed Accessibility Issue
- Added proper H1 heading to Admin login page for better accessibility compliance

## Remaining Issues for Future Work

### 1. Broken Images
The site has broken image references on multiple pages from both Unsplash and RandomUser API. This issue persists because:
- Images might be no longer available at the source URLs
- Unsplash might block requests from Netlify
- The Next.js image optimization might need specific configuration for Netlify deployment

**Recommended Solutions:**
- Replace external image references with local assets hosted within the project
- Implement proper image fallbacks when external images fail to load
- Use a Netlify-compatible image optimization strategy

### 2. HTTP Status 304 Responses
Multiple pages return 304 status codes during testing. This is actually a normal HTTP status indicating that the page hasn't been modified since the last request. The Puppeteer testing script incorrectly flags these as errors.

**Recommended Solutions:**
- Update the testing script to recognize 304 as a valid response code
- Alternatively, force Puppeteer to always request fresh content without using cache

## Next Steps
1. Configure the `NEXT_PUBLIC_ADMIN_PASSWORD` environment variable in Netlify deployment settings
2. Address broken images by replacing them with locally hosted alternatives
3. Implement proper error handling for any unavailable resources
4. Update the testing script to better handle valid HTTP responses like 304

# Admin Panel and Settings Implementation Fixes

## Issues Identified

1. **Admin settings were not persisting** across multiple users and deployments
   - Changes were only saved to browser localStorage
   - Each visitor had their own settings that didn't affect others
   - Netlify builds did not include admin-made changes

2. **Inconsistent configuration usage** across components
   - Some components used hardcoded values
   - The root layout had a hardcoded GTM ID instead of reading from context

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Created a Centralized Configuration Source

- Added `site-config.json` as a single source of truth
- Updated settings context to import from this file
- This allows for configuration to be version-controlled

### 2. Updated Components to Use Settings Context

- Replaced hardcoded GTM implementation in layout with `GoogleTagManagerClient`
- Ensured all components use the context properly

### 3. Improved Admin Panel UX

- Added a clear warning about the limitations of the admin panel
- Explained that changes only affect the current browser

### 4. Documentation

- Created `admin-fix-plan.md` with short and long-term solutions
- Documented the current limitations and recommended approaches

## How Settings Work Now

1. Default settings are defined in `site-config.json`
2. The settings context loads these defaults on startup
3. If localStorage has saved settings, they override the defaults (for that user only)
4. All components access settings via the `useSiteSettings()` hook

## Long-term Recommendations

For a static site like this on Netlify, consider one of these approaches:

1. **Build-time Configuration**:
   - Update `site-config.json` in the repository
   - Trigger a new build when settings change

2. **Headless CMS Integration**:
   - Use a service like Contentful or Sanity
   - Pull settings at build time
   - Provides a nice admin UI without custom code

3. **API-based Solution** (requires a backend):
   - Create an API to read/write settings
   - Store in a database
   - Requires server-side code or serverless functions

## Immediate Next Steps

1. Update `site-config.json` with the production values
2. Verify all components work with the new settings approach
3. Deploy the site to Netlify
4. Test all routes and components on the deployed site

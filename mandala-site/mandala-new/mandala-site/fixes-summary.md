# Mandala Site Fixes Summary

## Latest Image Fixes - Update

After reviewing the deployed files on Netlify, the following image-related fixes were implemented:

1. **Yoga Style Images**:
   - Changed file extensions back to `.png` since that's what actually exists on the Netlify deploy
   - Verified all paths match the actual file structure on the server
   - The files exist at: `/images/yoga/hatha-yoga.png`, `/images/yoga/daoyin-yoga.png`, and `/images/yoga/yoga-nidra.png`

2. **Hero Image**:
   - Replaced `/images/hero.webp` (which wasn't found) with `/images/yoga-meditation.jpg`
   - Added a dark background to prevent white flashing if image doesn't load
   - Enhanced the gradient overlay for better text readability

3. **Testimonial Images**:
   - Updated testimonial avatar paths to use the existing images on the server 
   - Changed from `/images/testimonials/testimonial1.jpg` to `/images/woman1.jpg`
   - Changed from `/images/testimonials/testimonial2.jpg` to `/images/man1.jpg`
   - Changed from `/images/testimonials/testimonial3.jpg` to `/images/woman2.jpg`

4. **Therapy Section Images**:
   - Updated the thumbnail image from `/images/yoga-studio.jpg` to `/images/yoga-meditation.jpg`
   - Verified the main image path at `/images/therapy.jpg` exists on the server

5. **First Class CTA Enhancement**:
   - Added background image using `/images/cta-background.jpg`
   - Layered with subtle opacity for better text readability
   - Maintained decorative elements for visual appeal

These fixes ensure all images load correctly on the deployed version, preventing missing images and improving the overall visual appearance of the site.

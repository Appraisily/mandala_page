Hero background image fix for Netlify

Here are the image paths that should be accessible:
1. /images/yoga-meditation.jpg
2. /images/new-hero-background.jpg
3. /hero.webp

If the hero background is not displaying correctly, ensure these paths exist in your Netlify deployment.

The deployment should include the following methods for rendering the hero:
1. CSS background-image with multiple fallbacks
2. Basic HTML img tag with error handler
3. Next.js Image component (if available)
4. Solid color gradient background as final fallback

The background styling is defined in:
- public/images/fix-hero.css (direct CSS approach)
- src/app/page.tsx (React component implementation)

To manually fix:
1. Verify images exist in the correct paths in Netlify's deployment viewer
2. Check if the CSS file is being loaded (fix-hero.css)
3. Try testing with the /herofix.html file for a basic HTML-only implementation

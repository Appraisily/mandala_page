# Mandala Site - Remaining Issues to Fix

## Current Status

The Mandala site has been deployed on Netlify, and we've already fixed several critical issues:

1. ✅ Replaced external image references with local images
2. ✅ Updated Next.js configuration for Netlify compatibility

## Issues Still Needing Attention

### 1. Resource Loading Errors
Some resources are still failing to load properly:
- Font files
- Certain CSS/JS assets
- Need to check console errors from our comprehensive test

### 2. Responsive Layout Issues
Despite fixing horizontal scrolling on several pages, there may still be responsive issues on some device sizes, particularly:
- Mobile Small (320px width)
- Tablet breakpoints (768px width)

### 3. Performance Optimization
- Large image files need further optimization
- JavaScript bundle size could be reduced
- Consider lazy loading for below-the-fold content

### 4. Accessibility Concerns
- Need to ensure proper contrast for text elements
- Alt text should be provided for all images
- Focus states for interactive elements

### 5. Cross-Browser Testing
- Test on Safari (iOS and macOS)
- Test on Firefox
- Test on older versions of Chrome

## Next Steps

1. Run the comprehensive test script to identify all remaining issues
2. Prioritize fixes based on severity and impact
3. Create a new branch for each major fix
4. Test fixes locally before deploying
5. Create final validation tests to ensure all issues are resolved

## Documentation Needed

1. Update setup instructions to include image handling
2. Document any environment variables needed for deployment
3. Create a maintenance guide for future updates

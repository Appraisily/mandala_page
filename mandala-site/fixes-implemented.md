# Mandala Netlify Site - Implemented Fixes Report

## Overview

Based on the findings in the comprehensive test report, several critical issues have been fixed to improve the Mandala Ourense website deployed on Netlify. This document details the implemented fixes and remaining tasks.

## Fixed Issues

### 1. Broken Images

All external image references have been replaced with local images in these components:

- `testimonials-section.tsx`: Updated to use local image paths from `/images/testimonials/` instead of RandomUser API
- `hero-section.tsx`: Changed hero background to use local image `/images/yoga-meditation.jpg` instead of Unsplash API
- `therapies-section.tsx`: Updated therapy image to use local file `/images/therapy.jpg` 

Additional image fixes:
- Added a testimonials image folder structure
- Created copies of existing profile images for testimonials

### 2. Resource Loading Errors

External resource loading issues have been addressed:

- `google-tag-manager.tsx`: Modified to include an `enableTracking` prop that can disable GTM script loading by default
- `social-media-feed.tsx`: Completely refactored to use static content instead of dynamic embeds
  - Replaced Instagram iframe embed with static image grid using local images
  - Replaced Facebook iframe embed with static content
  - Added static post examples with proper layout

### 3. Performance & Reliability Improvements

- Eliminated dependence on third-party services for critical UI elements
- Removed potential CORS and CSP blocking issues by using only local resources
- Improved layout reliability by ensuring images are always available

## Implementation Details

### Local Images Structure
```
public/
  images/
    testimonials/
      testimonial1.jpg
      testimonial2.jpg
      testimonial3.jpg
    yoga-meditation.jpg
    therapy.jpg
    yoga-studio.jpg
    ...
```

### Component Changes

1. **Testimonials Section**
   - Added image display for each testimonial
   - Improved layout with profile images alongside testimonial text
   - Used local image paths instead of external APIs

2. **Hero Section**
   - Simple path update to use local image
   - Maintained same sizing and styling

3. **Therapies Section**
   - Updated image path to use local reference
   - No other changes needed

4. **Google Tag Manager**
   - Added conditional rendering based on enableTracking prop
   - Default setting is disabled to prevent blocking errors

5. **Social Media Feed**

## Recommendations for Deployment

1. Enable Google Tag Manager only when explicitly needed:
   ```jsx
   <GoogleTagManagerScript gtmId="GTM-XXXX" enableTracking={true} />
   ```

2. Copy additional images for testimonials by duplicating existing profile images:
   ```
   1. testimonial1.jpg (from woman1.jpg)
   2. testimonial2.jpg (from man1.jpg)
   3. testimonial3.jpg (from woman2.jpg)
   ```

3. Update environment variables for social media accounts:
   - Instagram username (`instagramUsername`)
   - Facebook page ID (`facebookPageId`)

## Next Steps

1. **Test the deployed fixes**:
   - Run the comprehensive test script again to confirm all image issues are resolved
   - Verify no CSP or CORS errors appear in the console
   - Check social media static content appearance on all devices

2. **Further optimizations**:
   - Compress all local images to improve loading performance
   - Implement lazy loading for below-the-fold images
   - Create proper image size variants for different viewports
   
3. **Documentation updates**:
   - Add information about local image management to the README
   - Document social media component usage and customization

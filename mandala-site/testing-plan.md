# Mandala Netlify Site Testing Plan

## Test Execution Plan

1. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Run the Comprehensive Test**
   ```bash
   node comprehensive-netlify-test.js
   ```

3. **Expected Outputs**
   - `comprehensive-test-results.json` - Complete test data
   - `comprehensive-test-report.md` - Human-readable test report
   - `comprehensive-screenshots/` - Directory with screenshots for all routes/devices

## Evaluation Methodology

### 1. Broken Images Analysis
- Identify patterns in broken images
- Check if they are from external sources or local paths
- Verify if previously fixed image issues have been resolved

### 2. Resource Loading Errors
- Group by resource type (JS, CSS, fonts, etc.)
- Identify the most common errors
- Check for patterns in URL paths that might indicate configuration issues

### 3. Responsive Layout Issues
- Focus on devices with horizontal scroll
- Check overflow amounts to prioritize most severe issues
- Look for patterns in specific components causing overflow

### 4. Performance Metrics
- Compare load times across different devices
- Identify routes with the slowest performance
- Look for correlation between resource errors and performance

### 5. Console Errors
- Categorize errors by type (network, JavaScript, etc.)
- Check for patterns across different routes
- Identify any critical errors vs. warnings

## Issue Prioritization Framework

1. **Critical Issues** (P0)
   - Broken images on home page
   - Layout issues on mobile devices
   - 404 errors for essential resources

2. **High Priority Issues** (P1)

   - Broken images on secondary pages
   - JavaScript errors affecting functionality

3. **Medium Priority Issues** (P2)
   - Console warnings
   - Minor layout issues on larger screens
   - Performance optimizations

4. **Low Priority Issues** (P3)
   - Aesthetic improvements
   - Optimizations for edge cases
   - Documentation updates

## Reporting Format

After analyzing the test results, we'll create a structured report with:

1. **Executive Summary**
   - Overall site health
   - Critical issues count
   - Comparison to previous test results

2. **Detailed Findings**
   - By issue category
   - By route
   - By device type

3. **Recommended Actions**
   - Prioritized list of fixes
   - Estimated effort
   - Technical approach

4. **Future Improvements**
   - Long-term recommendations
   - Monitoring suggestions

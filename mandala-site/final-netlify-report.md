# Mandala Netlify Site - Final Report

## Executive Summary

The Mandala Ourense site has been successfully deployed to Netlify, and our comprehensive testing has revealed several key findings:

- **Broken Images**: 76 broken images were detected across 3 routes (/, /about, /terapias)
- **Resource Errors**: 60 resource errors, primarily related to external scripts
- **Console Errors**: Primarily related to failed resource loading
- **Performance**: Generally good performance metrics across all routes and devices
- **Responsive Design**: No horizontal scroll issues detected on any device/route combination

## Key Issues

### 1. Broken Images
Despite previous fixes to replace external images with local ones, multiple broken images still appear on:
- Home page (7 broken images)
- About page (5 broken images)
- Terapias page (3 broken images)

All broken images fall into two categories:
1. Images still referencing Unsplash API URLs (`images.unsplash.com`)
2. Images still referencing RandomUser API URLs (`randomuser.me/api/portraits`)

### 2. Resource Loading Errors
Two main types of resource errors were detected:
1. Google Tag Manager script being blocked by ORB (54 instances)
2. Instagram embed script being blocked by response (6 instances)

### 3. Console Errors
The primary console errors are related to failed resource loading, affecting all routes.

## Recommendations

### 1. Fix Remaining Broken Images
1. **Identify Components**: Based on the image paths, locate the components still using external image sources:
   - Testimonials section (using RandomUser API)
   - Classes/Therapy sections (using Unsplash images)
   - About page teacher profiles (using Unsplash images)

2. **Complete Local Image Migration**:
   - Download all remaining external images
   - Place them in the `public/images` directory
   - Update component references with local paths
   - Example format: `/images/testimonials/person1.jpg` instead of API URLs

### 2. Address Resource Errors
1. **Google Tag Manager**:
   - Review implementation and ensure it's properly configured for production
   - Consider implementing CSP (Content Security Policy) headers to allow necessary scripts
   - If not critical for initial deployment, consider temporarily removing GTM

2. **Instagram Embed**:
   - Replace the dynamic Instagram embed with a static solution
   - Consider using screenshots of Instagram feed instead of live embed
   - Alternatively, implement proper CORS headers if Instagram integration is critical

### 3. Performance Optimization
1. **Image Optimization**:
   - Run all local images through compression tools
   - Implement proper Next.js Image component usage with size optimization
   - Consider implementing lazy loading for below-the-fold images

2. **Bundle Optimization**:
   - Review and reduce JavaScript bundle size
   - Use code splitting for routes that load slowly (like /noticias)

## Testing Validation Plan

After implementing the fixes above, run the following validation tests:

1. **Image Loading Test**:
   - Re-run the comprehensive test script
   - Verify zero broken images across all routes
   - Manually verify image quality after optimization

2. **Resource Loading Test**:
   - Check console errors after GTM and embed fixes
   - Validate that critical functionality works without blocked resources

3. **Performance Validation**:
   - Compare performance metrics before and after optimization
   - Target 20% improvement in load times for the slowest routes

## Conclusion

The Mandala site is functioning well on Netlify with no responsive layout issues, but still requires fixing to address broken images and resource loading errors. With these improvements implemented, the site will be ready for production use with high performance and reliability across all devices.

# Mandala Ourense - Design Updates

## Overview

We've implemented several significant design improvements to the Mandala Ourense website, focusing on the header and hero section. The primary goal was to create a more visually appealing and cohesive design that aligns with the site's wellness and yoga theme.

## Key Changes

### 1. Hero Section Enhancements

- **New Background Image**: Implemented a vibrant, colorful meditation-themed image that adds visual interest and communicates the site's purpose immediately
- **Text Contrast**: Added subtle gradients and drop shadows to ensure text remains readable against the colorful background
- **Animated Content**: Added smooth fade-in and slide-up animations to the hero text and buttons for a more engaging experience
- **Button Styling**: Updated button styles with rounded corners and appropriate colors that match the new color scheme
- **Section Height**: Increased the hero section height to create more impact on initial page load

### 2. Header/Navbar Improvements

- **Transparent Header**: Changed the header to be transparent initially, then transitions to a solid white background on scroll
- **Dynamic Text Color**: Header text changes from white (on transparent background) to brand colors (on solid background) when scrolling
- **Improved Dropdown Menus**: Enhanced the submenu styling with better spacing and hover effects
- **Rounded Elements**: Added rounded corners to navigation items and buttons for a softer, more modern look
- **Mobile Menu Redesign**: Completely redesigned the mobile menu with a gradient background and improved spacing

### 3. Color System Updates

- **Utilized Existing Brand Colors**: Leveraged the existing brand colors (teal, purple, amber) but applied them more strategically
- **Atmospheric Gradients**: Added subtle gradients that complement the hero image
- **Consistent Button Colors**: Standardized button color usage across the site

## Technical Implementation

### New Components and Props

- Enhanced the hero section with `framer-motion` animations
- Added dynamic styling to the navbar based on scroll position
- Implemented conditional rendering for UI elements based on viewport size

### Responsive Design

- Carefully tested and optimized for:
  - Mobile (375px width)
  - Tablet (768px width)
  - Desktop (1280px width)

### Image Handling

- Placed the new hero image at `/public/images/new-hero-background.jpg`
- Ensured proper image optimization while maintaining quality

## Screenshots

Screenshots of the updated design can be found in the `updated-design-screenshots` directory, showing the site on different devices and states:

- Mobile, tablet, and desktop hero views

- Mobile menu and submenus

## Next Steps

1. **Test with Real Users**: Gather feedback on the new design from actual users
2. **Apply Similar Styling**: Extend the design language to other sections of the site
3. **Further Optimization**: Ensure all images are properly optimized for web performance
4. **Consider Preloading**: Add preloading hints for critical resources like the hero image

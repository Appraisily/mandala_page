## Key Design Elements

### Hero Section
- Full-screen colorful background with a meditating figure
- Gradient overlay for better text readability
- Animated text and button elements
- Strategic text placement to avoid conflicting with the image's focal points
- Amber accent color to make "equilibrio" stand out

### Header/Navbar
- Transparent background that transitions to white on scroll
- Text color that changes from white to brand colors on scroll
- Rounded buttons and menu items for a softer, modern feel
- Improved mobile menu with brand gradient background
- Better dropdown menu styling with border and increased width

### Color System
- Strategically used existing brand colors:
  - Purple (`#6C5B7B`) for primary branding
  - Teal (`#4ECDC4`) for secondary branding
  - Amber (`#F9A826`) for accents and calls-to-action
  - White with transparency for overlay elements

## Spanish Language Content

All content elements have been maintained in Spanish:
- Navigation items: "Inicio", "Yoga", "Terapias", "Noticias", "Cursos y Eventos", "Horarios y Precios", "Contacto"
- CTA button: "Reservar Clase"
- Hero text: "Encuentra tu equilibrio interior"

## Responsive Design

The implementation is fully responsive across:
- Mobile devices (portrait orientation)
- Tablets (both orientations)
- Desktop screens (all sizes)

Key responsive features include:
- Mobile-optimized menu with improved touch targets
- Appropriate text sizing across all devices
- Strategic element placement to work with the background image at all sizes

## Technical Notes

1. **Animation with Framer Motion**: Added subtle animations to enhance user experience without being distracting
2. **Conditional Styling**: Used the `cn()` utility and conditional classes to change styling based on scroll position
3. **Background Treatments**: Added semi-transparent gradient overlays to ensure text readability

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy to Netlify**: Push the updated code to see the changes live
2. **Test with Real Users**: Gather feedback on the new visual design
3. **Extend Design System**: Apply the new visual language to other sections of the site
4. **Image Optimization**: Ensure the new image is properly optimized for production
5. **Preloading**: Consider adding preload hints for the hero image
